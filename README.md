Longhorn Sidebar for Rainmeter
=======================
This is a fork of fediaFedia's Longhorn Sidebar skin for Rainmeter.

- It is tweaked for 40px top-aligned taskbars.
- It fixes Reserve Screen Space not working by replacing it with a non-AutoIt
  version.
- It replaces fonts from "Segoe UI" to "Old Segoe UI," so that it uses my
  computer's Windows 7 font.
- It fixes the BigClock component having no background when using
  HillelNoShadow.
- The build tag has been changed to be more accurate to 4074. Also, you can
  toggle the sidebar by right clicking it.
    - This uses layouts LonghornX1 and LonghornX1NoSidebar, so make sure to
      overwrite LonghornX1 before using it.

To install, clone this repository to your `Rainmeter/Skins` folder, copy the
contents of `Layouts` to `%APPDATA%/Rainmeter/Layouts`.

If you still have the sidebar's work area changes, run `WorkArea\workarea.exe`
with no arguments.
